In this folder are the various HTML and CSS files that I used for my Web Programming class. In this class, one of our projects involved making a hotel website from scratch. These files were used to create the website, but the website is only viewable through the program XAMPP. Even though the website itself is not viewable, the code depicts what is displayed to users on the website.
